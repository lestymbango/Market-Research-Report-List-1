<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Suspension Arm Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dependent Suspension</li><li>Independent Suspension</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The suspension arm market is primarily divided into two categories: dependent suspension and independent suspension. Dependent suspension systems use a single set of arms for both wheels on an axle, meaning movement on one wheel affects the other, often leading to a simpler design and lower cost. Independent suspension, on the other hand, allows each wheel to move independently, offering better handling, ride comfort, and traction. This market caters to diverse vehicle types, influencing performance and driving experience.</p></p>
